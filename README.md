# Classification_Of_Geospatial_Data

# Introduction
Detecting change through multi-image, multi-date remote sensing is essential to developing and understanding of global conditions. This challenge uses features obtained from satellite images using computer vision for further processing using machine learning.


# Objective
The aim of this project is to build a robust classifier able to classify a given geographical feature into one of six classes

# Methodology
We tried in this project multiple models, such as : 
                
                - KNN
                
                - SVM with Text Categorization
                
                - XGBoost 
                
                - Random Forest
                
                - Multi-XGBoost

For a better understanding of the project, deatiled methodologies were explained in the report.
